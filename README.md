No particular smart stuff here:
First find all pairs of on/off times that meet the stated requirements for duty cycles. Index these pairs for each of on and off times.
Next find each group of 4 contiguous on times and work out all possible complementary off times. Within this set is single one with two distinct pairs off off times.
For that unique group, calculate the 4 duty cycles.
Repeat for 4 contiguous off times and pairs of on times.
